# VRVision
Augmented Reality app to help with vision impairments

Solo school project which I choose to complete as part of my course work for my IB Diploma.

Part of this project was identifying a pre-exising issue which could potentially be solved by creating a code based solution for the project, referring to a client or expert to get advice on how to tailor the project.

Video Demonstration of the project:
